I can’t believe you posted that picture. You look so weird in it.

Why are you always so annoying in the group chat? Just stop spamming memes all the time.

That answer in class today was actually pretty good, nice job.

Bro, you played really well in the match yesterday. I’m proud of you.

You are such an idiot sometimes, do you ever think before you speak?

No one likes you in this server, you always make everything awkward.

Can you please stop being so toxic? People are just trying to have fun here.

Your project presentation was amazing, very clear and well explained.

Shut up already, you’re not funny and everyone is tired of your lame jokes.

You’re not useless, but sometimes you act like a total loser for no reason.

Honestly, that message was kinda harsh. Maybe rephrase it next time.

Go away and stop bothering everyone, nobody wants to hear your trash opinions.

I don’t hate you, but your behaviour in the chat today was really disappointing.

Why do you always have to be so rude? It makes you look dumb, not cool.

Even if you think it’s a joke, calling people ugly or stupid can really hurt them.
